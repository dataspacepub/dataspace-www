Hello, and welcome to Dataspace Publishing! ![our logo](/static/img/icon/180x180.png)

As you saw on our landing page, we're a publishing company with a new attitude. As experienced web serial authors ourselves, [Justin]({{< ref "/authors/justin-c-louis" >}}) and [Phil]({{< ref "/authors/philip-r-johnson" >}}) know that web fiction is a growing and powerful genre, free from the constraints of conventional publishing. Web authors are free to explore ideas, themes and concepts with no hand on the wheel but their own, and we believe that part of the medium's success has been this freedom to innovate.

Up until now, the obstacle preventing web authors from moving from the Internet to the bookshelf has been quite simple: traditional publishers don't want to print a book that readers can already view in its entirety for free.

The technology of printing and publishing has moved forward alongside the Internet, however, and nowadays the best print-on-demand services are capable of producing limited print runs, or even single books, in a quality indistinguishable from existing offset print methods. We believe this represents an opportunity for you, as an author, to add your work to bookshelves, bookstores and libraries around the world. We believe that if your story already has loyal readers, they would be willing to buy and own a physical copy, perhaps with your signature on it! We believe that if your story is new and unseen, the time has never been more right to share it with the world.

We believe, in short, that there's nothing stopping you.
