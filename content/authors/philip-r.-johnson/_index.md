{{< /portrait >}}

Born and raised in rural Wales and blessed with a bedroom full of books, Phil
has written and roleplayed from a young age. Under the pen name Hambone, he
became a professional author through his successful web serial *The Deathworlders.*
Now based in Yorkshire, his passion is for character-driven speculative fiction
and aliens with unpronounceable names.
