A native of the upper Midwest, Justin has always had a passion for writing,
technology, and the secrets of human systems. He is a veteran of the U.S. Air
Force, and has successfully served careers in both intelligence and information
systems. These days he is a network engineer based out of Bismarck, North
Dakota, where he admires the spartan outdoor beauty surrounding his home.
