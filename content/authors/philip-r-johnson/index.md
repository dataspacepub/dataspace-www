## About the author

Born and raised in rural Wales and blessed with a bedroom full of books, Phil has written and roleplayed from a young age. Under the pen name Hambone, he became a professional author through his successful web serial *The Deathworlders.* Now based in Yorkshire, his passion is for character-driven speculative fiction and aliens with unpronounceable names.
