## Hello!

_Technology has always brought big changes to the way we read. From the very first printing press, to the present day, each innovation has brought new ways for writers to present their unique stories. Now, we live in the age of web fiction and there is no longer a barrier to publication. Anybody who wants can put their work online for free, for anybody to read._

At Dataspace, though, we think there’s a certain charm to having a physical book in your hands, or up on your shelf.

Books are fun to own, they are a good way to show your appreciation for your favorite creators, and of course the creators themselves aspire to have their work in print.

Our mission is to bring web fiction and similar independent works to your shelf. We’re agnostic on genre, we embrace the unusual, and we love stories that have already been read and enjoyed by thousands!

And if you’re a writer yourself, we hope you will join us and share your story with the world.
